Hello! Welcome to Pyccel! Thank you very much for your contribution :heart:.

I am the GitHub bot. I will help guide you through the different stages necessary to validate a review in Pyccel. If you haven't yet seen our developer docs make sure you check them out [here](https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel/tree/master/developer_docs). Amongst other things they describe the [review process](https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel/blob/master/developer_docs/review_process.md) that we have just started. You can also get in touch with our other developers on our [Pyccel Discord Server](https://discord.gg/2Q6hwjfFVb).

To begin with I will give you a short checklist to make sure your pull request is complete. If you want me to run any specific tests to check out corner cases that you can't easily check on your computer, you can request this using the command `/bot run X`. Use the command `/bot show tests` to see a full list of the tests I can run. Once you have finished preparing your pull request and are ready to request reviews just take your PR out of draft, or let me know with the command `/bot mark as ready`. I will then run the full suite of tests to check that everything is as neat as you think before asking other contributors for reviews. You can get a full list of commands that I understand using `/bot commands`.

Here is your checklist:
- [ ] Update AUTHORS file

Hello! Welcome to Pyccel! Thank you very much for your contribution :heart:.

I am the GitHub bot. I will help guide you through the different stages necessary to validate a review in Pyccel. If you haven't yet seen our developer docs make sure you check them out [here](https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel/tree/master/developer_docs). Amongst other things they describe the [review process](https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel/blob/master/developer_docs/review_process.md) that we have just started. You can also get in touch with our other developers on our [Pyccel Discord Server](https://discord.gg/2Q6hwjfFVb).

To begin with I will give you a short checklist to make sure your pull request is complete. If you want me to run the tests you can request this using the command `@bot run tests`. Once you have finished preparing your pull request and are ready to request reviews just let me know with the command `@bot mark as ready`. You can get a full list of commands that I understand using `@bot commands`.

Here is your checklist:
- [ ] Update AUTHORS file

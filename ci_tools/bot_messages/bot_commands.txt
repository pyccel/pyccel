This bot reacts to all comments which begin with `/bot`. This phrase can be followed by any of these commands:
- `show tests` : Lists the tests which can be triggered
- `run X` : Triggers the test X (acceptable values for X can be seen using `show tests`). Multiple tests can be specified separated by spaces.
- `try V X` : Triggers the test X (acceptable values for X can be seen using `show tests`) using Python version V. Multiple tests can be specified separated by spaces, but all will use the same Python version.
- `mark as ready` : Adds the appropriate review flag and requests reviews. This command should be used when the PR is first ready for review, or when a review has been answered.
- `commands` : Shows this list detailing all the commands which are understood.
- `trust user X` : Tells the bot that a new user X is trusted to run workflows (prevents misuse of GitHub actions for mining etc). This command can only be used by a trusted reviewer.
- `accept coverage` : Tells the bot that the coverage errors have been investigated and cannot be fixed in this PR.

Beware: if you have never contributed to this repository and you are not a member of the Pyccel organisation, the bot will ignore all requests to run tests until permitted by a trusted reviewer.

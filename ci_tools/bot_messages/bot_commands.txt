This bot reacts to all comments which begin with `/bot`. This phrase can be followed by any of these commands:
- `show tests` : Lists the tests which can be triggered
- `run X` : Triggers the test X (acceptable values for X can be seen using `show tests`). Multiple tests can be specified separated by spaces.
- `try V X` : Triggers the test X (acceptable values for X can be seen using `show tests`) using Python version V. Multiple tests can be specified separated by spaces, but all will use the same Python version.
- `mark as ready` : Runs the PR tests. If they pass then it adds the appropriate review flag and requests reviews. This command should be used when the PR is first ready for review, or when a review has been answered.
- `commands` : Shows this list detailing all the commands which are understood.
- `trust user X` : Tells the bot that a new user X is trusted to run workflows (prevents misuse of GitHub actions for mining etc). This command can only be used by a trusted reviewer.

Beware: if you have never contributed to this repository and you are not a member of the Pyccel organisation, the bot will ignore all requests to run tests until permitted by a trusted reviewer.

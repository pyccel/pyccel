**Pyccel** stands for Python extension language using accelerators.

The aim of **Pyccel** is to provide a simple way to generate automatically, parallel low level code. The main uses would be:

1.  Convert a _Python_ code (or project) into a Fortran or C code.
2.  Accelerate _Python_ functions by converting them to _Fortran_ or _C_ functions.

**Pyccel** can be viewed as:

-   _Python-to-Fortran/C_ converter
-   a compiler for a _Domain Specific Language_ with _Python_ syntax

Pyccel comes with a selection of **extensions** allowing you to convert calls to some specific Python packages to Fortran/C. The following packages will be (partially) covered:

-   `numpy`
-   `scipy`

Pyccel's acceleration capabilities lead to much faster code. Comparisons of Python vs Pyccel or other tools can be found in the [benchmarks](https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel-benchmarks) repository.
The results for the devel branch currently show the following performance on python 3.10:

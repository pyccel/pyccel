# Supported Libraries

Pyccel supports a limited subset of the libraries available in Python.

Currently we fully support:
-   `math`
-   `cmath`

We additionally have support for the specified functions from the following libraries:
-   `itertools` : `product`
-   `numpy` : See [NumPy functions](./numpy-functions.md).
-   `scipy` : `constants.pi`
-   `sys` : `exit`

If you need support for a library which is not mentioned here, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel/discussions/categories/ideas) and we will investigate whether this can be added simply.

# Benchmarks

Several tests are available for the user to benchmark Pyccel against other common accelerators, notably [pythran](https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/).
The same code is used for all tests, only the decorators change.

The code can be executed by running the script `run_benchmarks.py`.
Additional options can be used with this script to add additional comparisons, change the output format, or change what is generated.

Run `python3 run_benchmarks.py --help` for more details.

## Tests used

The tests used can be found in the [code/](./code) directory

### Ackermann

A basic implementation of the Ackermann function which is one of the simplest and oldest examples of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive.

### Bellman Ford

An algorithm for solving the shortest path problem. The code is adapted from examples written by [J. Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/py_src.html)

### Djikstra

An algorithm for solving the shortest path problem. The code is adapted from examples written by [J. Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/py_src.html)

### Euler

Solves an ordinary differential equation using Euler's method. The code is adapted from examples written by [J. Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/py_src.html)

### Midpoint Explicit

Solves an ordinary differential equation using the explicit midpoint method. The code is adapted from examples written by [J. Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/py_src.html)

### Midpoint Fixed

Solves an ordinary differential equation using the implicit midpoint method with a fixed number of iterations. The code is adapted from examples written by [J. Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/py_src.html)

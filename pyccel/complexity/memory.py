class MemComplexity(Complexity):

    Class for memory complexity computation.
    This class implements a simple two level memory model

    Example

    >>> code = '''
    ... n = 10
    ... for i in range(0,n):
    ...     for j in range(0,n):
    ...         x = pow(i,2) + pow(i,3) + 3*i
    ...         y = x / 3 + 2* x
    ... '''

    >>> from pyccel.complexity.memory import MemComplexity
    >>> M = MemComplexity(code)
    >>> d = M.cost()
    >>> print "f = ", d['f']
    f =  n**2*(2*ADD + DIV + 2*MUL + 2*POW)
    >>> print "m = ", d['m']
    m =  WRITE + 2*n**2*(READ + WRITE)
    >>> q = M.intensity()
    >>> print "+++ computational intensity ~", q
    +++ computational intensity ~ (2*ADD + DIV + 2*MUL + 2*POW)/(2*READ + 2*WRITE)

    Now let us consider a case where some variables are supposed to be in the
    fast memory, (*r* in this test)

    >>> code = '''
    ... n = 10
    ... x = zeros(shape=(n,n), dtype=float)
    ... r = float()
    ... r = 0
    ... for i in range(0, n):
    ...     r = x[n,i] + 1
    ... '''

    >>> M = MemComplexity(code)
    >>> d = M.cost()
    >>> print "f = ", d['f']
    f =  ADD*n
    >>> print "m = ", d['m']
    m =  2*WRITE + n*(READ + WRITE)
    >>> q = M.intensity()
    >>> print "+++ computational intensity ~", q
    +++ computational intensity ~ ADD/(READ + WRITE)

    Notice, that this is not what we expect! the cost of writing into *r* is
    'zero', and therefor, there should be no :math:`n*WRITE` in our memory cost.
    In order to achieve this, you must tell pyccel that you have the variable
    *r* is already in the fast memory. This can be done by adding the argument
    *local_vars=['r']* when calling the cost method.

    >>> d = M.cost(local_vars=['r'])
    >>> print "f = ", d['f']
    f =  ADD*n
    >>> print "m = ", d['m']
    m =  READ*n + WRITE
    >>> q = M.intensity(local_vars=['r'])
    >>> print "+++ computational intensity ~", q
    +++ computational intensity ~ ADD/READ

    and this is exactly what we were expecting.
